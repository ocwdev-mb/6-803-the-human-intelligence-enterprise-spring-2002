In the table below, "Communication assignment" refers to the form that the student's written assignment should take. For example, if the assignment refers to "press release," the student's submission should be in the form of a press release. "Communication hors d'oeuvre" refers to the introductory first half hour of class that is spent discussing communication heuristics.

Some assignments may refer to "WRT," which stands for "Winston's Reading Time" – the length of time the professor needed to read the paper, which students can use to estimate their reading time, once they have calibrated themselves against the professor on the first few assignments.
